My primary research interests lie in <font color="blue">machine learning</font>, particularly at the intersection of applied probability, dynamical systems, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199"><font><i>modern</i></font> neural networks</a>. While my work focuses on leveraging foundational questions to advance the science and engineering of learning systems, the theory is closely connected to implementation challenges and a broad spectrum of practical applications across the sciences. 
<br>

Some central themes of interest:<br>
- **Generative AI:** how to improve existing generative modeling methods, particularly for learning sequential data 
- **Sequence modeling:** how to use ML to model and learn sequential data, particularly those with underlying non-trivial dynamics 
- **Robustness:** how to leverage randomness to make ML safer and more reliable
- **Optimization:** how to understand and improve optimization algorithms in ML meaningfully

At a high level, my research is inspired and driven by the following fundamental question: 

<font><i>Given a data set/model, a learning model and a learning algorithm, can we build a principled yet practical framework to *explore* and *exploit* the behavior of the learning model on test data, in various regimes and for various settings? </i></font>
<br>

*I also maintain a <a href="https://shoelim.github.io/DSxML/">personal journal</a> to keep track of the progress in the research areas that I am interested in.

In particular, I apply and develop ideas and tools from several areas of probability theory, stochastic analysis, statistical learning, statistical mechanics and dynamical systems to address problems concerning <font color="blue">open dynamical systems</font> arising in statistical mechanics and machine learning. <br>

Open systems are, in a broad sense, components of a larger closed system that interact with other components of the larger system. These systems abound in applications and are typically random/stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional and have non-trivial dynamics. Studying physical and artificial systems rigorously within an appropriate open systems framework allows us to gain valuable insights into these systems. The overarching theme of my current research revolves around using probabilistic and statistical approaches to understand <font color="blue"><i>learning of dynamical representations</i></font> and <font color="blue"><i>physics of dynamical systems</i></font>.  <br>
