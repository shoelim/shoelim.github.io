Dynamai is a fundamental machine learning (funML) research lab grounded in applied mathematics. We focus on addressing meaningful problems over abstract elegance, developing and applying mathematics to understand, improve, and advance ML systems with real-world impact. Our research spans **generative modeling**, **sequence modeling**, **robustness and reliability in ML**, and **ML for science**.
