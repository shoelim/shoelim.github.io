Dynamai is a fundamental AI research lab grounded in applied mathematics and statistics. We pursue research to understand and advance AI systems, closing the gap between mathematical rigor and real-world impact through approaches that are both theoretically principled and effective at scale. Our main areas of interest include the foundations of **generative AI**, **sequence modeling**, **robustness and reliability** in ML, and **AI for science**. We work closely with research groups and institutions around the world, partnering with leading researchers to accelerate discovery and impact.
