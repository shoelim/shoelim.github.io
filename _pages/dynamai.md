**Dynamai** is a *research and innovation group* dedicated to advancing the intersection of dynamical systems and artificial intelligence (AI). We are driven by a passion for transforming academic excellence into real-world impact, aiming to produce both high-quality publications and practical solutions at this exciting frontier.
Our research explores the interface of mathematical statistics and computational sciences, bridging theory and application to drive innovation. Our main areas of interest include the mathematical foundations of <span style="color: blue;">generative AI</span> and <span style="color: blue">sequence modeling</span>, <span style="color: blue">robustness and reliability</span> in ML, and <span style="color: blue">AI for science</span>. We actively collaborate with research groups and institutions around the world, partnering with leading researchers to accelerate discovery and impact.
