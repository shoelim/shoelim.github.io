Dynamai is a fundamental machine learning (funML) research lab built on applied and computational mathematics, focused on shaping the next generation of ML through mathematical insight and principled methods. Our research spans **generative modeling**, **sequence modeling**, **robustness and reliability in ML**, **ML for science**, and beyond. 

Discover and explore our latest research on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/lim_s_1.html) and our open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/dynamai).
