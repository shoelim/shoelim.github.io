- I am an applied mathematician working in <font color="blue">machine learning</font>. I also work in [<font color="blue">mathematical physics</font>](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mathematical+physics) and, broadly speaking, <font color="blue">probability theory and its applications</font>.  <br> 
- I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/shlim?l=en">Division of Probability, Mathematical Physics and Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/math/department-of-mathematics-1.833813">Department of Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> since July 2024. I am also affiliated with <a href="https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/profile/soon-hoe-lim/">Digital Futures</a> and  <a href="https://www.nordita.org/">Nordita</a>, hosted jointly by <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a> and <a href="https://www.su.se/">Stockholm University</a>. I am a <a href="https://winq.se/">WINQ</a> Fellow since June 2021 and was a Nordita Fellow from 2018-2021. <br>
- I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">University of Arizona</a> in May 2018, under supervision of <a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/people/wehr">Jan Wehr</a>. Prior to that, I studied mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, initially delving into [actuarial mathematics](https://www.soa.org/).  <br>
